  # Fix Dreams Table RLS Security Issue

  This migration fixes the critical security vulnerability where dream interpretation 
  results were visible to all authenticated users instead of only the owner.

  Problem:
  - Current policies use `USING (true)` and `WITH CHECK (true)` 
  - This allows all authenticated users to see, modify, and delete any user's dreams
  - This is a major privacy and security issue

  Solution:
  - Replace permissive policies with proper user-specific policies
  - Ensure users can only access their own dreams
  - Maintain proper authentication checks

-- Drop existing permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own dreams" ON public.dreams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own dreams" ON public.dreams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own dreams" ON public.dreams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own dreams" ON public.dreams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON public.dreams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to manage dreams" ON public.dreams;

-- Create secure RLS policies that restrict access to owner only
CREATE POLICY "Users can view only their own dreams"
  ON public.dreams
  FOR SELECT

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_dreams_created_at ON public.dreams(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_dreams_is_analyzed ON public.dreams(is_analyzed) WHERE is_analyzed = true;
