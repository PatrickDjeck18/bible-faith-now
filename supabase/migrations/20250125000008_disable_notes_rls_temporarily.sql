  # Temporarily Disable Notes RLS for Testing

  This migration temporarily disables RLS on the notes table to test if the issue
  is with the RLS policies or with the authentication setup.
  
  WARNING: This makes notes visible to all authenticated users!
  Only use this for testing, then re-enable proper RLS.
